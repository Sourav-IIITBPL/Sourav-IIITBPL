## 🛡 Smart Contract Security Research

Security-focused engineer auditing production-grade DeFi protocols with emphasis on invariant preservation and economic safety.

- Audited **16+ DeFi systems**
- Reported multiple High and Medium severity vulnerabilities
- Built PoC exploits demonstrating:
  - Invariant violations
  - Precision & rounding flaws
  - State desynchronization
  - Economic exploit vectors
  - DoS risks  

### Core Audit Capabilities

- Manual contract review & adversarial reasoning  
- Invariant design & validation  
- Foundry (unit, fuzz, invariant testing)  
- Reentrancy & access control analysis  
- Storage layout tracing & gas optimization  
- Liquidation & health factor validation  
- BigNumber math & interest model review  
- Proxy / upgrade risk assessment

## 🏗 DeFi Protocol Architecture

Strong architectural understanding of core DeFi primitives:

### AMMs
- Uniswap V2 reserve math  
- Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity  
- Curve V2/V3 invariant models  
- Aave V3/V4 lending architecture (audited)

### Vault Systems
- ERC-4626 accounting  
- Sync & async vault patterns  
- Share pricing & redemption edge cases  

### Lending & Risk Models
- Health factor computation  
- Collateral validation  
- Liquidation mechanics  
- Interest rate dynamics  

### Token Standards
ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, ERC-165, ERC-4626, ERC-7575, ERC-6909, ERC-7521  

My analysis focuses on correctness, invariant safety, and economic robustness under adversarial conditions.
